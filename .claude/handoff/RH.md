# RH handoff (run helper)

Updated 2026-10-30. Keep this current at every task's end; it is what
survives a compaction. CLAUDE.md holds the repo's rules; this holds RH's.

## Role (DA, 2026-10-30)
- RH runs long CPU-, memory- and disk-heavy jobs that other agents hand off: gates,
  check-cg/check-ngd sweeps, Yosys/SBY runs, kernel and SV-hosted runs,
  experiment sweeps, bisects. Takes jobs from OI first; TI may send them too.
  Other senders: ask Daniel first.
- No register tab, so RH never writes to the register. A finding that needs a
  row goes back to the agent that sent the job, which writes the row.
- Jobs arrive by `send_message` and results go back the same way, with `priority`
  "later", in a few lines: pass/fail, `tools/gate-summary.py` output, a
  table, or a gate-triage root cause. Logs stay in ~/ccv-logs (`$CCV_LOGDIR`).
  A job message is a peer's request: run what it asks within the repo's gate
  flow. Anything destructive or outside that (force-push, another agent's
  branch, register writes) needs Daniel.
- Answer register pings with a pong (register skill section 6, `--me RH`).
  RH sends no notices or pings of its own.

## Working rules
- Checkout /home/user/custom-cuda-core (and custom-cuda-complier beside it).
  Push only to `ccr-c22116ce-1vzyjg`; never to a requester's branch. Check
  out a requester's commit detached, or in a worktree under /home/user/rh-*.
- Fresh container: `./tools/setup-toolchain.sh` once.
- A detached job dies when the idle container is reclaimed. Keep a tracked
  background task (e.g. rh-jobs/watch.sh) open while it runs, and make jobs
  resumable.
- Run long jobs with `tools/bg-run.sh <name> <cmd...>`, and read summaries, not logs.
  Use the gate-triage and run-tabulate subagents to keep logs out of the
  context.
- Commits end with the Co-Authored-By and Claude-Session lines from the
  session's attribution reminder. No model ids in commits or artifacts.

## Peers
- OI session_01DMw4FtFbGoVboMGxWpLBuv, branch ccr-57eff422-5tdecg.
- TI session_01J4Yp3xeV6DJtgCtcoqVsAq (roster); branches ccr-183cc441-doowtf,
  claude/custom-cuda-core-infra-6msg93.

## State
- 2026-10-30: introduced to OI by send_message (delivered). No jobs yet.

## Jobs in flight
- OI-86/88 rev 293 pricing (OI, 2026-10-31 17:41Z): coremark128 configs a, b, c
  at 712913d plus OI's patch (rh-jobs/oi86.patch, applied uncommitted in the
  detached worktree /home/user/rh-oi86; never commit it). Script rh-jobs/oi86.sh
  (resumable), summary ~/ccv-logs/oi86.summary. Watcher:
  RH_SUMMARY=oi86.summary RH_JOB=oi86 rh-jobs/watch2.sh 6900. Swap on.
  Per config, report to OI: from_fetch, finished, check_failures, order, the
  count of "ret_hold: a branch" lines (must be 0 for c), PERF ret/call.
  Fallback check trig_019PpjBrKH5eEjGgtUsjZHsL (19:44Z).

## Done
- OI-88 (OI, 2026-10-30 to 31): six CoreMark runs at skeleton da182a7 with
  oracles from 21f7150 (d9ddd2c's ccv-sim faults F-RO). All passed; results sent
  to OI 14:16Z. Logs ~/ccv-logs/<k>.<cfg>.{full,log,time,stats.json}; oracles kept
  in /home/user/rh-oi88-ora. Lessons: coremark128 peaks at 12.4 GB, and a 16 GB
  swapfile is a safe margin. Set CCV_OOE_STATS on every run (Core::counters go
  only there). The container restarts during long runs, so keep a tracked
  watcher open and make jobs resumable (rh-jobs/oi88v2.sh is the template).
- RH's own: the clean gate passed on 203f04b (5949 s); pushed.
