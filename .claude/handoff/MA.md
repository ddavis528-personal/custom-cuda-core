# MA handoff (MIU and DCU architecture)

Session `session_01QPk2jyUbWA7fW9YpUwqdxk`, started 2026-11-13. Start doc:
`docs/miu-arch.md` (AR's handoff). Branch `claude/miu-dcu-microarch-spec-664pgr`
in custom-cuda-core (and the same name in custom-cuda-complier, unused so far).

## Working rules beyond CLAUDE.md

- MA owns the MIU and DCU tabs of *Per-block architecture specs*
  (doc 63a486a6-7f71-4c05-82e8-e696c74779b4; MIU body aa7a288a-dae2, DCU body
  c18a112b-d2c6). AR no longer edits them. MA never edits schema/params: a
  change is an MA row with TI in Needs, after AR agrees where it crosses a block.
- Register: MA tab body `1f971016-3f72` in doc JApHYjaUESeq8tsGMGXMU5
  (Opens table and Responses table; columns ID|Decision|Severity|Impl|Needs|Description
  and Re|Date|Impl|Response). Notify per `.claude/skills/register/SKILL.md` section 2.
- Daily sweep: trigger `trig_015gBGZ169gCKj4KbpYm5bhB`, 02:35 Pacific.
- Docs edits: a `find` replace "as text" inherits the first run's formatting
  (bold/code); for whole paragraphs use a guarded markdown replace.
- A rendered copy of a tab: read with `{"kind":"view"}` and render with the
  scratchpad script render.py (strips XML to `[id h=]` lines). Rebuild it if
  the scratchpad is gone.

## State, 2026-11-13

- Roster: MA's session id written (commit "register: MA is ...").
- Phase 0 done: miu-arch.md section 5's stale list is fixed in the MIU tab
  (Q-18 closed, cmpl 120 bits and its field table, rcu_data field table, the
  L1 contract's RA-43 numbers 18/14, encodings, alignment, F-WIDTH, bulk
  discard with loads and the atomics exemption, the S1 model text, 8 inbound
  wakes, tier labels, the sectioned footprint) and in the DCU tab (the held note).
- First-pass draft written, marked proposed: MIU tab section "MA's Phase 1
  draft" (L1-hit budget strawmen A/B, lane-group coalescing and the contract
  eligibility rule, the 32-entry memop queue and credit, req_id 6/5 bits,
  ordering/drain/TLB/miss path, the event list for coverage bins); DCU tab
  "MA's Phase 1 draft" (64 KiB 8-way baseline, 4R tags + 4 data banks,
  D1-D3, 16 miss buffers with 4-way merge, fill path, eviction, probes).
- Grill-me raised: MA-1..MA-14 (rev 3). Notices sent to AR, OA, IS, TI.
  MA-13 is DA's (compute priority; MI/DI start).

- Agreed since: MA-1..8, MA-10..12, MA-14 (AR rev 344); MA-4 with OA (OA-408/410:
  early 1-bit no_hit on ccv_miu_ooe_cmpl_hint, TI applied on ti-ma); MA-5 per-slot
  credits (AR 345, re-affirmed 347 after the withdrawn 346): CCV_MEMOP_CREDITS = 10 a
  slot, OOE sends on the first credited slot within pipes; MIU keeps one 40-entry
  queue, each entry's arrival slot (2b) for the credit and lead pipe ctz(pipes) for
  the address pairing, and a 4-bit owed count per slot (credit return is 1 pulse a
  slot a cycle). OI-138 measured the select at 0 NGD, so the pool fallback is closed.
- MA-13 (DA): no compute priority; MI and DI start only after the grill-me with AR
  is finished, a summary is delivered to Daniel, and everything is documented.
- session-home installed (`tools/setup-session-home.py --check` matches).
- MA-15 (params/schema bundle) is on TI's branch ti-ma, not yet landed.
- Gate note: a scoped gate on a branch carrying many merges runs nearly every
  section; check-cg/check-ngd took over 1h serial. Run gate-push under the 2h
  background limit or via tools/bg-run.sh with the max timeout.

## Open work, most urgent first

1. MA-9 (MIU-DCU boundary): waits on AR's capacity sweep (64 vs 512 KiB, L1_HIT
   5/7/8). When it closes, the grill-me is finished.
2. Then: the summary to Daniel (all MA rows, decisions, what changed in the spec
   tabs), and confirm everything is documented. Only after that, MI and DI
   handoffs (docs/miu-impl.md, docs/dcu-impl.md).
3. Track MA-15 landing (TI, ti-ma); close MA-15 and the TI parts of MA-2/3/5/6/12.
4. Phase 2: module partition, per-port NGD budgets, index-lead schema row (after
   AR's sweep), the payload-slot macro decision.
