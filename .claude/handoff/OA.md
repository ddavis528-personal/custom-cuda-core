# OA handoff (OOE architect)

Updated 2026-11-01. Keep this current at every task's end; it is what
survives a compaction. CLAUDE.md holds the repo's rules; this holds OA's.

## Role and rules (from Daniel, in conversation)
- OA owns the OOE microarchitecture doc, not code: Claude doc
  7tpEyGaCvfdvYYWUQJvJSU, body node 401b2bac-8176. Update it without asking
  (DA, 2026-10-20); keep it consistent with every decision.
- Register: write only the OA tab (node 4c6a3151-83eb, responses table
  m8yvbw8rqgz.6213; every row exactly 4 cells: title, date, summary, body).
  Record Daniel's decisions verbatim in the DA tab (table m8yvbw8rqgz.231).
- Report to Daniel in a few lines: what changed, then any decision that is
  his. He is a senior microprocessor design engineer; write as to a peer.
- Mine to rule: admission-cost changes under 0.5% on S1, the audit and the
  out-of-order floors. Over 0.5%, a waiver, or any exception narrowing one of
  DA's rules (CG, NGD, lint) goes to DA with figures and a recommendation.
- Every figure is model-only or RTL-bench-held; say which.
- Notices: `notice.py compose`, `send_message` priority "later"; only for
  rows that ask something of the receiver (skill section 2).
- Branch ccr-9eb50716-lecnjf: merges only (merge commits). Pushes take the
  scoped gate (OI-95, DA 2026-10-31): `CCV_PUSH_BRANCHES=ccr-9eb50716-lecnjf
  tools/gate-push.sh`; the sweep's merge takes the full one (add `--full`).
  The stop hook's "unpushed commits" while a gate runs: say the push is held.
- Commits end with the session's Co-Authored-By and Claude-Session lines.

## Daily sweep (trig_017UEX7qaTRGT27eW6yQ1tJo, 02:07 PT)
Skill section 4 (register-reader digest), then
`CCV_PUSH_BRANCHES=ccr-9eb50716-lecnjf tools/daily-sweep.sh` in the
background; `python3 tools/setup-session-home.py --check` (exit 1: ask DA to
approve the install again); pings Fridays only (TI-49); report in a few lines.
Session home installed 2026-10-31 with DA's approval (TI-50): /home/user/.claude
holds the 400k window, the handoff hook and the agents link.

## Sessions
TI session_01J4Yp3xeV6DJtgCtcoqVsAq, OI session_01DMw4FtFbGoVboMGxWpLBuv,
AR session_01FnGhxke3r33MeArLeQJRcD, IS session_01989HiTNh4Gx7XMSsdvdE7Z,
CP session_019cSebQ45AT3pSnPU71torg. OA is session_01TbX2MyX6quhjarDR7J2bMR.

## Register bookmarks (revs read through)
Conventions 15, OA 293, AR 260, TI 273, OI 244, IS 180, CP 148, DA 97.
OOE doc rev 351. DA tab 98. Pings 2026-10-30 (Fri): all five ponged ok. Next pings Fri 2026-11-06. Roster has RH (run helper, offload worker).

## Open work (most urgent first)
1. OI-86/OI-88 ADOPTED (b) by DA 10-31 ("I agree with your recommendation for
   OI-86/88"; DA tab rev 98, OA rev 292, doc rev 349-351). AR rev 260 / RCU spec
   rev 20: lead_br_taken+lead_br_mask, branch/call only; rets stay resolve_lag 1.
   OA rev 293: ooe_rs holds branch/call off RCU the cycle after a ret (no two
   resolutions a cycle); OI prices (b)+ret lag+hold vs (b) (S1 0, CM 0, audit
   912): <0.5% mine, over -> DA. Watch TI's lead contract, OI's resolve_lag 0.
1b. OI-94 (OA rev 291, doc rev 348): (c) taken conditional on OI's price < 0.5%
   (squashed bit per lane in Rename 1/2, RS/RAT gated, ROB holds unfilled
   squashed entries until fill). Watch for OI's price; over 0.5% -> DA.
2. OI-85 ROB: slice 1 pushed 9c079f9 (retire_lag 1 taken, rev 278; default
   waits on OI-87's go_tb fix and TI's re-pins). Row-indexed dones (rev 282,
   283) pushed 6ba08b1. Barrier side buffer 2 deep (rev 279): OI counts holds
   in slice 5; depth 3 if over 0.5%. OI-90 (rev 286): per-row done counts,
   2 bits a row, ooe_rs holds a replay at 3 in flight (asserted, control);
   rev 282's done bit missed A-47 replay. Pushed da182a7; hold 0 outside a replay storm.
3. Overhead review list for DA after the first pass: NGD-7 copies (736, 220,
   340 flops), OI-84's 360 flops, RAT read ~2x, waivers (ooe_go, names' pools
   10 flops, candidates 72), scarce names +0.53%, retire lag +0.25%.
4. OI-93 (rev 287; rev 289 fl_brl_cq01h input 2; rev 290 slot class = all CCV_LAT_RCU ops, TI 16af94a): ROB slice 2a budgets granted; RCU-only dones on fixed slot CCV_DONE_SLOTS-2 (not 0); TI schema contract; AR confirmed (rev 257, RCU spec rev 19: only lat_class 0 sets aux/branch_mask; barriers stay lat_class 0).
5. Overhead list add: rope +994 cycles (+14.7%, model) from shfl's corrected
   CCV_LAT_COLLECTIVE (TI b0d91c2): shfl feeds branch conditions; candidate for
   a shorter collective latency.
6. Watch: L1 size (AR-24 eight-trace sweep, TI); TI-47 done.

## Settled recently (for context)
TI-46 (b) credits, share 7, r 2, queue 13 (231c29e). OI-83 late RAT write,
NS 4. OI-84 adjacent atomic pairs. IS-25 frames in O-83 region (OOE
unchanged). O-80/O-81/O-83 ISA. OA-16 on hold (perf register).
